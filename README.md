# Sorting algorithms visualization
After selecting an image, the program shuffles the pixels, and then sorts them.

## What kind of algorithms?
You can choose one of 8 sorting algorithms:
- Bubble sort
- Quick sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Shell sort
- Cocktail sort
- Merge sort
- Randomly (each step randomly choose one of the above sorts)

## Size and speed
There isn't speed slider, because it is unnecessary when you can resize pixels by scrolling mouse wheel. The smaller the pixels, the longer they sort.
